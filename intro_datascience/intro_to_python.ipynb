    "# Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Like javascript and php, python is an interpreted language. Python's syntax is also relatively different from everything we've seen so far. Unlike languages like javascript and php, python was designed for readability, and uses no curly braces like other languages. Python as a language can be used for writing command line scripts, servers, or even web pages (similar to how we write web pages with php and html). This introduction to python is to get you up to speed with the language before we jump into writing a web crawler. \n",

    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Many, if not most computers come with python preinstalled. To ensure that python is installed on your machine, type: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Windows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```powershell\n",
    "C:\\Users\\<YOUR USERNAME>python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mac:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should receive a message either says `command not found` OR something that looks akin to: \n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "Python 2.7.3 :: Continuum Analytics, Inc.\n",

    "If you received a `command not found` error, go to [Python's webpage](https://www.python.org/) and download either Python 2.7, or the newest version of Python 3 (as of now, Python3's most up to date version is Python 3.7.4). For the sake of most, Python 2.7 is the standard version that already exists on computers, so we'll stick with that. If you've downloaded a more recent version, the code should not be that much different, however you may have to make minor changes on the code that can be found in the documentation. \n",

    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Python syntax is not entirely similar to other languages. We'll see more when we get to control flow and functions, but python is a language that, instead of enforcing scope through curly braces like javascript, php, etc., it uses indentation. Additionally, python's logical operators are different from those of other languages we've used up to now as well. \n",

Just like most other languages, `int` stands for integers (such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc), and `float` stands for a number with a decimal point (e.g. 0.1, 0.2, 0.0000003, etc). `complex` is used for imaginary numbers (which we won't be covering beyond noting that they exist).\n",

    "Not every class is as simple as one that just stores data. Suppose your class needs to do a bit more heavy lifting you'll need to create a constructor. Python constructors are significantly different from constructors in other languages, specifically in that they are not named the same name as the class with a function parameter, they instead are a function called `__init__`. Additionally, the very first parameter of this function must always be a reference to the instance calling the class. Typically, it's written as `self`, however, if you're familiar with c-style languages, think of `self` as python's version of `this`. Let's take a look at a more significant class: "
