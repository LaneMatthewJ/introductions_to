# Topics Of Interest

11/13's session didn't have many folks show up, so for the sake of not moving too far ahead, we spoke of some neat topics and libraries out there to work with instead of moving forward with the code: 



## Plotly: 

Plotly is a graphing library that can create interactive graphs! It is extremely powerful! What's gerat is that there are many tutorials [on their site](https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/#where-to-next) as well! 

## Creative coding and Generative Art: 

Using code to create images/videos is not necessarily new. [Processing](https://processing.org) is a language that allows for free reign in graphic manipulation. It's very similar to java in its own right. There are a number of books, tutorials, classes, and single videos online for processing. 



Additionally, Processing has a javascript version as well to run in node environments called [p5.js](https://p5js.org). 



While Processing is very powerful for drawing, it can also be used for creating generative art. There are a number of communitites where you can find extremely neat images/videos/sounds created. Many can be found on reddit: 

[r/creativeCoding](https://www.reddit.com/r/creativecoding/) and [r/proceduralGeneration](https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/) are both great resources. 



## Artificial Intelligence for Engineers: 

A vast majority of resources on AI are available on the internet, however, many of them presuppose that you have a degree in math, and just naturally understand extremly advanced concepts. [Fast.AI](https://www.fast.ai) is not one of them! The courses on this site are relatively in depth, but they explain a lot in very simple terms! 11/10 would recommend! 



## Curious Video Series: 

There exists a conference in st Louis called Strange Loop. At this conference there are many talks ranging from cloud architecture with Google's Kubernetes to writing generative audio and visual art to using natural language processing for simplifying legal documentation. What's fantastic about this organization is that the vast majority of their talks are all posted online! Take a look at these videos on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_QIfHvN9auy2CoOdSfMWDw/videos).
